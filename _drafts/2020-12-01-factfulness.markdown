<p style="text-align: justify">Hans Rosling was a swedish doctor and lecturer at Karolisnka Institutet (School of medicine). He gave numerous talks around the world (you should watch a few of them at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpKbO6O3O3M">Youtube</a> üçø. He swallows a sword at the end of the talk, not kidding) to many sort of people, from regular ones who attended to a TED Talk to world leaders gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He also cofounded the Gapminder Foundation, heading one goal: bring light to the truth by assessing objetive data.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Try to answer this questions:</p>
<header style="background-color: #F7F7F7; border-radius: 20px; padding: 10px">
<p style="text-align: center"> At poor countries, how many young girls finish primary education?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> a) 20%       b) 40%      c) 60%</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center">In the las 100 years, the number of deaths by natural desasters has...</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> a) more than doubled       b) remained roughtly the same      c) decreased to less than half</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center">Nowadays, around the world, how many childs less than 1 year old recieved at least one vaccine?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> a) 20%      b) 50%      c) 80%</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I have to admit that the first time I made this test I didn't get any right answer to any of this questions. If you chose the c) for all of them, you are right: the world is not going from bad to worst as we usually tend to think. But, why we always put ourselfs in the worst scenario? Why we always believe that trends never change? or why we always think in a binary way: good or bad, right or wrong, rich or poor, ....?. Throughtout this book the author talks about different common topics like deltas between rich and poor countries, health assistance, reteriment funds, education and a bunch of other stuff that matters, and he shows how our primary instincts like fear, negativity, sense of fate or generalization can define our image of the world.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Lets think about poor countries. When we talk about poor countries we always imagine almost the same dramatic scenes of people withouth clothes and no food, living in the streets and so on, and we usually tend to think that all the poor countries are like that, because we live in a rich world and they live in a poor one (binary mindset bias). But how we get that image? At school, thats right, when we were childs, 30 years ago, and the teacher show us a picture of one of those countries. But, when was that picture taken? Probably not when we were childs, probably when our teacher was a child, that means at least 60 years ago. So we get an image of nowadays poor countries by looking at a 60 years old picture. Maybe at this point you agree with me that doesn't make sense. But maybe you think now that things hasn't change too much from 60 years ago, maybe today poor countries are even worse than they were in the past, because if something went bad in the past then today it is even worse (trends does not change -> bias). All right, so if trends wouldn't change, you probably now are 4 meters tall, because when you were 10 years you were 1 meter and 20 centimeters tall, so if in ten years you grew that size then ten years later you should be 2 meters tall, and when you are 30 years old you are 3 meters tall, and when you are 40 years old... Now you are probably thinking that: "ok, maybe some poor countries have change from the past a lot, but the most of them are still living in extreme poberty, so we can say that an average poor countries are really poor. And you can notice that by looking at countries like Sudan, Mali, and others". That is a clear case of generalization bias.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to say that there are no poor countries nowdays because that is not objectively true. There is still lot of people who strugles to have a dignified life with acces to the basic needs. But what I mean to say is that looking at real data, nowadays there are much less countries that lives in extreme poberty, fortunatelly. The problem here is that we tend to think that everything which is under our life conditions is poberty, and that is not true. So how can we define poberty in an objective way? Well, maybe the life span and the income are a pretty good indicator of how poor or rich we are. Look at the following graph taken from <a href= "https://www.gapminder.org">Gapminder Foundation website</a> (which I encourage you to visit, really worth it):</p>

<iframe src="//www.gapminder.org/tools/?embedded=true#$state$time$value=2020;;&ui$presentation:true;&chart-type=bubbles" style="width: 100%; height: 500px; margin: 0 0 0 0; border: 1px solid grey;" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">As you can see the countries are clasified into four groups according to the life span and income per capita of their citizens, and the size of each bubble represents the population of the country. As you could notice, in 1800 all the countries where placed at level 1 and 2. But 200 years later almost of the countries are in level 4 and 3, and thats a great improvement. But not only that, look at the life span of countries that were in level 1 in 1800, 35 years old, right? And now look at the life span of the level 1 countries but in 2020: 60 years old!!! That means that even for extreme poor countries, life conditions have improved a lot too. Now people in that countries live longer because the have access to much and better food, own better houses that protect them from climate disasters and also have access to vaccines and other basic medicines that prevent them to die young. And this is something that we should hightlight!!! Obviously there is a lot of room for improvement, but we are in the right direction.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">By reading this book you will discover much more real data about topics like we have seen in this short article. It is surprisingly amazing how human beings tend to figure out about everything around us by a bias thinking. In this book the author decluters all those bias from our head by showing how assessing the real data is the best way to get the truth. But, does the people really want to know the truth?</p>
