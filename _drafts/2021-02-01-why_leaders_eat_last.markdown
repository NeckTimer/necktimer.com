<p style="text-align: justify">Good personal relationships and a meaningful job are for many psychologists the keys for a happy and purpose life. Unfortunately these days many people is struggling to achieve not only one but the two things, making them feel depressed and with the feeling of not making impact in their life.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">According to Simon Sinek’s theory, modern capitalism founded by economist Milton Friedman is making many companies culture too much toxic for the employees. Financial profit is the only goal that companies usually target and workers are just a mean to achieve it. The office environment is much more similar to a jungle where each individual is trying to protect himself from inside dangers rather than a collaborative tribe where everyone helps and protects each other from hazard coming from the outside. At the end this problem could be summed up as a lack of leadership inside the organization. As Simone Sinek says in his book “Leaders eat last”, a leader is not a person who order the tasks to the employees but it is the one who protects and takes care of their people. It is commonly said that the leaders of the companies, usually referred to CEOs or middle management roles, must exercise authority. But the authority, understanding this one as the action of taking technical decisions, should lie on the people who is in the front line because they are the ones who have the information about the issue, whereas the top management must exercise protection and define the vision for the employees.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Many people is nowadays struggling at work thinking all day about if they are going to be fired, or that the other department or colleague  is trying to play foul, or thinks like that. And in the most of the cases this thoughts are not triggered because of a lack self esteem, competence or good performance from the employee. Many companies are used to firing people just because they have not hit their profit goal for the year. It is absolutely crazy if we think deeply about it. Many good workers are made redundant just because of a figure, but also some workers with a high potential but a temporary poor performance are also fired. It is like your son or daughter comes back home with bad grades at the end of the season and you say to him: ok, we are gonna give you up for adoption. With that corporate cultures it is completely reasonable that the employees end up hating their jobs and not committed at all with the organization.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">In the best scenario the employee feels the pressure during all day because of this harmful environment, but many times the feeling of a none purpose job make the situation even worst.  This feeling is very common among millennials employees, who tend to think they are not making a great impact in their life and that their work is not being valued. That generation is usually qualified as the arrogant one, because they think they deserve everything, but not only that, they think they deserve everything and right now. I’m a millennial and to be honest I must admit that definition about our generation is totally true. Since we were child we’ve been over protected, our parents have tried to give us everything while we were young, they told us that we deserve everything even when we did things wrong. It is funny to think that even for the last qualified in an athletic race for kids there was a medal, “because participating is what matters”. But in the real world that is not the case, there’s no trophy for the last one or the one that make things wrong, even sometimes there’s no prize for the best. In my opinion we should be much more humble. But on the other hand there is no problem with our approach to work and life if we take responsibility for our behavior. What’s wrong in searching for a purpose? What’s wrong in quitting your job is you think you are not helping any other? Money is not everything, and I guess millennials we have learn to value our time and to prioritize experience over stuff and money. We have realized that we only live once so the idea of being frozen to a seat just because is a glamorous company and the salary is great is not the way we want to spend our time. In the same way I think we should be humble and not demand others what we can do by ourselves, I also guess we are doing right when finding our purpose and taking responsibility for the risks we take. At the same time we should be conscious that it is very likely that we end working in a company where corporate culture will not match our values so we must be prepare to deal with that, but keep searching or building one that really does.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Fortunately not all the companies foster a toxic culture for their people. Inside some organizations when an employee is going through a performance slump for three months in a rope for instance, his team leader instead of saying to him: “your sales are decreasing during the last three months, so if this situation keeps going on something bad is gonna happen”, they just said to the employee: “are you ok? Do you feel good? I ask you this because I’m worried about you, I feel your performance is going down and maybe you are going through something bad in your life, can I help you in some way?” What a difference. Bob Chapman is one of the CEOs that has been setting up this culture inside his companies since many years ago and the results are coming. At his companies business revenue is just the fuel and not the goal. He strongly takes responsibility for his employees happiness and that attitude makes them not to think about their job just only as a way of paying the bills, their mates are like a family for them because they feel the protection so when the company has problems everyone inside is committed to protect the tribe. Why do they do that? Why each employee helps and takes care about the other? Because they feel the others would do the same for them. They feel that the danger come from the outside and not from the inside of the organization. They feel that their leaders take care of them because they see how the leaders sacrifices for them. It is not about the salary, perks or other benefits. It’s because of the sense of belonging to a family and the feeling of making their part to something bigger than themselves.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">If you want to know more about how a collaborative culture inside organizations can ensure employees satisfaction and happiness I strongly recommend reading “Leaders eat last” by Simon Sinek and “Everybody matters” by Bob Chapman. These readings will not only let you know more about the reasons behind good leadership success but also how to implement that culture inside your company. Because being a leader is not about a hierarchical position but about an attitude of service, it’s about eating last to ensure your people gets enough food.</p>
