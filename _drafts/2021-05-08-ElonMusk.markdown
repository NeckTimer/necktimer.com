- A great vantage point of Elon Musk life, from his early years to 2017, going through his endeavours, fails and success in business realm and personal life.
- What it takes to set up a new tech company, some great ideas to copy and some mistakes to avoid. The way this business world works and the hazards you could be expose to inside it.
- How SpaceX, Tesla and Solarcity operate inside their sector and the relations and simbiosis between them. How this companies changed the approach to space, automotive and mobility, and energy generation.


### The book in 3 sentences ‚òïÔ∏è
- Elon Musk is not the typical businessman who only cares about money and financials, his main goal is not earning money. He serves to a higher purpose above all that: his goal is to save the human being from any disaster that could appear by turning our specie into a multi planetary one. That's why he invested all the money in his companies, gone broken at the early stages.
- SpaceX business model is focus on making the access to the space much more affordable that is was just few years ago. Thanks to this approach and other factors the space sector has grown during the last decades from  60K to 200K millions dollar.
- SpaceX, Tesla and Solarcity, main Elon Musk companies, live together under a perfect symbiosis. SpaceX provides with new materials and technologies to SpaceX, Tesla supplies Solarcity with his battery technology, whereas Solarcity serves Tesla as energy resource at his road superchargers.


### Childhood in South Africa
In 1884, when he was 12, Elon Musk created his first video game called "Blastar", with 167 lines of code. At the age of 14 he entered an existential crisis. He resorted to philosophical and religious texts but they were apparently not of much help. After reading the book "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams he found his mission in life: "Aspiring to the collective improvement of human beings lifes is the only thing that makes sense" in his own words. Elon's father, Errol, was a mechanical and electrical engineer, and his mother Maye was a model and dietician. Elon is the oldest of three siblings, the middle one is called Kimbal and the little Tosca. From a very young age, Elon was an inveterate reader. He could spend ten hours a day reading, and he would hide in book stores to enjoy reading.
His parents divorced and Elon and Kimbal went to live with his father, who was a tyrant and tight-knit and exerted psychological pressure on them. That family background joined with the fact that Elon was a nerd geek since he was little and with zero social skills ended up making Elon not enjoying his childhood. While he was waiting for the visa to move to Canada, taking advantage of his mother's Canadian citizenship, at the age of 16 he enrolled in a South African university, which he later dropped out of. He says that he enrolled not to be idle until the papers arrived but the gossips say that he did it to get rid of military service.


### Moving to Canada
When Musk arrived to Montreal, it turns out that the great-uncle he was planning to visit was no longer living there, he had moved to Minnesota. Of course, the trip was not very well planned on Musk's part. He eventually contacted a cousin who lived in Swift Current and stayed with him. For a year he was working as a farmer growing potatoes and sowing wheat. This is how he celebrated his 18th birthday. He then went to work as a boiler cleaner, a high-risk job.
Elon enrolled in Queen's College, Ontario, which he preferred over Waterloo because there were more pretty girls. Still 18 years old, Elon and Kimbal had fun finding the phone number of successful people and calling for an interview. One of the people they called was Peter Nicholson, a senior executive at the Bank of Nova Scotia. When they met 6 months after the Musk's call, he liked the guys so much that he offered her an internship at the bank for the summer, and eventually Musk became his trusted advisor.
Apparently the traits that most distinguished Musk in his youth when he was in college was his passion, competitiveness and stubbornness in both educational and love affairs. Apparently the boy was not taking a *no* for an answer, neither from a girl nor from a teacher who did not want him to raise a couple of tenths that would make him have a ten out of ten on the exam.
After spending two years at Queen he received a scholarship from the University of Pennsylvania, considered among the top eight in the USA, and there he enrolled in economics and physics. At the student residence he met the one who would become his best friend, Adeo Ressi. The two rented a house with ten rooms and organized night parties with up to 500 people in it.


### College at USA
Taking advantage of his stay at the university in Pennsylvania, his brother Kimbal and he decided to drive all over the USA. As they did, they thought about business ideas related to the Internet. In 1994 Musk got an internship, for the first half of the summer, at an ultracapacitor company called Pinacle, based in Silicon Valley, which was exploring the use of ultracapacitors as a constant source of power in electric and hybrid vehicles. At the same time, and during the afternoons Musk worked for another company called Rocket Science Games that was focus on video games development. 


### Zip2
The first company that Elon and Kimbal Musk created was called Zip2, which consisted on a list of companies. It was like a Google Maps for listing businesses, from large corporations to local pizzerias. Musk was in charge of the technical part of the programming and Kimbal of the marketing and customer sales part. The two literally slept in the seedy office they had rented and showered at the YMCA gyms. It was very difficult for them to get clients. At that time, companies thought it was absurd to have a presence on the Internet. Eventually a VC fund invested in the company, allowing them to jump from the California landscape to that of the entire country. In exchange, Musk had to give up the management of the company, which he did not enjoy at all.
In 1998 Zip2 reached a merge agreement with its competitor CitySearch, but it finally did not materialize due to the fact that several executives and important employees of Zip2 went against it, putting their positions at risk due to duplication of functions. This situation was used by Musk to ask the council to remove the CEO, but his request was rejected. Elon Musk wanted to be CEO again. After the merge failure the company was in trouble but finally Compaq bought it for about 300 million dollars, of which Elon and Kimbal pocketed 22 and 15 million respectively.
The experience of Zip2 helped Elon to realize that investors are investors, that is, they do not care about the vision of the company but about money, and therefore letting them taking over the company was a mistake. He also learned to lead teams: ‚ÄúNormally you expect people to behave like yourself. But this is not the case because they do not have the same information as you do. That is why it is very important to ask yourself what will be the reaction of people with the information they have". The problem was that the people around him could accept his technical ability, but they didn't see him as a leader.


### X.com Vs Paypal
X.com was Elon Musk's first banking project. It basically consisted of a digital bank, which at the time was quite disruptive and was perhaps the first digital bank in history. It did not impose commissions or overdraft fees on its customers, and it also offered a money transfer system by which it was only necessary to enter the recipient's email address. But they had come up with a tough enemy who basically offered the market the same thing. It was called PayPal.
The competition between PayPal and X.com was so fierce that it led the two companies to run out of cash, causing them to join forces in 2000 and merge. The merging company was named X.com and its majority shareholder was Elon. The company grew and had more than ten million customers, but as it grew, cyber attacks and scams were more and more frequent. This caused the company to have more losses than profits.
Just as Elon left on his honeymoon, and although some loyal Musk employees tried to avoid it, some executives took the opportunity to stage a coup and convince the board of directors to remove Musk as CEO and put the former Paypal CEO in his place. That same month the company was renamed as PayPal.
In July 2002, after resisting the dot-com outbreak two years before, eBay bought PayPal for $ 1.5 billion, of which Musk pocketed $ 250 million ($ 180 million after taxes).
The experience of Zip2 and PayPal left Musk in not a very good position in front of investors and executives, as he showed few skills to be CEO. In addition, many considered that he exaggerated the capacity of his technological creations and that his character was egocentric and that he underestimated and insulted other people. But, truth be told, many of the products that PayPal created under his direction are still used today, for instance the anti-fraud and online protection software. His vision was also successful, he was able to detect future customers needs.


### Moving to LA and rockets
After being kicked out of PayPal Elon thought it would be nice to move to LA with his wife, because he liked the city. In addition, large companies from the aeronautical sector like Lockheed, Boing or NASA itself had headquartered in the nearby, and Musk had in mind the idea of rockets and space exploration since he was a child. Furthermore, there was an organization called *The Mars Society* that studied, in a scientific and realistic way, everything related to Mars and the possibilities of establishing life there. No brainer for Elon, he did not think twice and joined that society but it would not take long for him to resign as director of The Mars Society and found his own one, which was called *The Life to Mars Foundation*, whose mission was focused on carrying out R&D projects related to the exploration of Mars and bring the first humans there. His first idea was to buy the rockets from Russian companies because it was cheaper, but after meeting with that companies (which, by the way, did not take Elon's endeavours seriously) he decided that he would build the rockets by himself. This is how he started the business of low-cost space devices manufacturing in the USA, and that is how his company, *Space Exploration Technologies*, was founded.


### SpaceX
The problem that existed in the aerospace sector in economic terms was that every time they wanted to go to space, NASA contractors (Boing, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, etc) ended up building a Ferrari when most of the time a Honda Accord was enough for leaving our planet . This fact made any rocket manufacturer dependent on large government contracts to make its activities profitable. Instead Musk intended each individual lunch to be financially profitable. In addition, he had the support of the military community, which saw space as a new point of attack in the event of conflict, and of the scientific community that required tests to be carried out more frequently and at a lower cost than they were used to. The problem was that unlike other traditional manufacturers that are supported by governmental budges, SpaceX could not afford too many trial / error launches because they simply did not have funds for it. At most three or four attempts could be allowed for a successful launch of its first rocket, the Falcon 1.
The good news for Musk was that, in 2002, PayPal went public and eBay bought it for $ 1.5 billion. Musk took about 180 million from that operation and was able to invest about 100 million in SpaceX. But the good news about the PayPal deal came accompanied by a personal disaster: Elon's daughter, Nevada, died of sudden death when she was only 10 weeks old.
Musk hired prominent recent graduates from America's top universities for SpaceX. For the kids it was an incredible way to fulfill their dream without having to go through the bureaucracy that reigned in traditional companies like Boing or Lockheed. As time went by, more and more experienced engineers from such companies wanted to be hired by SpaceX, wishing they could also work without bureaucratic obstacles and thus be able to freely deploy their talent.


### The electric car
With SpaceX already up and running, a young engineer highly interested in creating electric vehicles contacted Musk to discuss his idea. Straubel's meeting was initially to introduce him to the idea of creating an electric plane, which was what Eberhard (Straubel's colleague) wanted, but Elon was not interested in this. However, he gave them 10k of the $ 100k they needed to develop the idea. Musk was shocked by the capabilities of the new lithium batteries used in computers and telephones and the possibilities they could have in electric vehicles. Eberhard and Tarpenning decided to start a company in a small office, they named it *Tesla Motors.* After inquiring with suppliers and marketers of the automotive sector, they decided that they would be the ones who would sell the cars without going to any dealer, and that the most technically feasible thing was that the first car they built would be a super sport car, because regular cars or SUVs are too heavy, whereas a super sport car only has two seats and is ultralight. They took the chassis of a Lotus Elise and attach the electric motor and batteries to it. But for the first prototype they needed about $ 7 million. A couple of VC funds decided to support them but it was not enough, so they turned to Musk again and he invested 6.5 million, which made him the largest shareholder of the new company. So Musk called on Straubel to join the project and bring in all his knowledge and research on lithium batteries that he had done with the money he gave him earlier. Basically Tesla was founded by a couple of car enthusiasts who teamed up with a university battery and electric prototype researcher with access to the Stanford student world, with Elon Musk in the background.

Basically Tesla's initial plan was to take a Lotus Elise, add the electric engine and powertrain of the tZero (a prototype electric sports car developed by AC Technologies), while the engineers that Tesla was incorporating had to dedicate themselves to the wiring. , packaging the batteries and cutting the chassis when necessary. The hot point was to see how a lot of small lithium batteries mounted in parallel worked, because no one in the world had carried out such an experiment.
Tesla's strategy was to sell the high-cost models first to earn money, so they would be able to launch more affordable models later on. The main Tesla advantage, compared to the rest of the car manufacturers, was that it operated as a start-up: if a problem comes out they solve it at that moment, while in large corporations too much bureaucracy was required before any tiny changes is permitted, delaying all the project.
At first Tesla had enormous problems with the production and supply chain: the different components went around the world before being assembled, the batteries were made in Taiwan, then they were sent to Thailand to be assembled in packages, the motor came from China and had to go to the UK for Lotus to assemble it, Lotus sent the cars with the batteries to LA through Cape Horn ... well, Tesla paid for the whole car with a period of 9 months in advance until it collected some of the customers money ... financially unsustainable. The conclusion was that the Roadster had a production cost of $ 200k while the selling price was $ 85k. They expected that with the increase in production and wholesale orders the balance would be positive but the unit production costs did not fall below $ 170k, and what is worse, a third of the vehicles produced did not work ... The consequence of all these problems was that Tesla decided to fire Eberhard as CEO.
The transmission had to be completely redesigned from two speeds to a single speed, and this led to a redesign of the electric motor and the inverter in turn ... they practically had to start from scratch with the consequent delay in production and delivery dates, angering many customers. To got the point, one of the goals targeted by the new CEO, Michael Marks, was that the separation between the bodywork parts should not exceed 40mm ... yes, 4cm of gap at most already it was an improvement for them...no comments. Marks' ultimate goal for Tesla was to clean it up enough to make it attractive to a large car group that would buy it, but that was not Musk's plan and so hired a new CEO: Ze'ev Drori, who was to be more like Musk's executing arm.
Something that characterized Musk at both SpaceX and Tesla is that despite the billionaire investor and CEO, he did not hesitate when it comes to getting grease on his hands when there was a problem. If there was a serious wiring problem in a rocket he would go to the hangar, put on some gloves and lay down on the ground under the fuselage to check the connections himself. Or if there was a problem with the doors of the Roadster he would take his private jet and fly to the UK to supervise the assembly in person.
Employees used to quit after joining few months ago, and several senior former employees left as they could no longer bear the strenuous pace. In addition, Tesla was practically bankrupt, the Roadster had cost about 140 million dollars to develop, when it was expected to cost the 25. 


### Falcon 1 reaches the orbit and Tesla is saved
The 2008 was a very complicated year both professionally, with SpaceX and Tesla in financial agony, as well as personally as Elon divorced from his wife Justine. However at the end of that year a ray of light appeared from the sky.
SpaceX failed in its first three launches due to various technical problems. They only had money left for a fourth launch, which if successful would attract investors and boost SpaceX, but if it went wrong it would be game over and leave Musk broke. Fortunately, the Falcon 1 performed flawlessly on its two-phase ascent to Earth orbit, making SpaceX the first and only private company to achieve that. However, the financial problems were not going to be solved in the short term, above all taking into account the world economic situation at that time. Musk doubted whether he had to split the money between SpaceX and Tesla, or on the other hand, bet everything on one of them even if that means one company will certainly die. He was literally bankrupt even having to borrow money from one of his millionaire friends, and while Tesla was losing about four million dollars per month‚Ä¶ the struggle to pay weekly payrolls was real. At SpaceX, on the other hand, they were involved in the development of the Falcon 9 and the Dragon capsule, the latter destined to transport passengers and goods to the ISS. At the time NASA put out a contest for that ISS supply mission and SpaceX seemed to be the chosen one. With loans approved by NASA for SpaceX Musk diverted part of the funds to inject them into Tesla. SpaceX managed to win the contest and secured $ 1.6 billion in payment for 12 flights.


### Falcon 9
With the Falcon 9 SpaceX went from being the freshmen of the aerospace industry to the envy of traditional aircraft manufacturers. Musk's company offered launches for about $ 60 million each, much less than other companies charge. In addition, SpaceX has one more advantage: all its rockets are manufactured 100% in the USA, without having to go through Russian or Chinese hands as it happens to other manufacturers. Currently SpaceX carries out at least one commercial launch a month, either to put a satellite of a country or private company into orbit or to supply the ISS. Although the profit margin is small for the company, in the past decade the space market boomed from $ 60 billion to $ 200 billion so by making many launches the profit is not low.


### Model S
In 2012 Tesla launched its first sedan, the Model S. It had a range of 450 km, an acceleration from 0 to 100 in less than 5 seconds, up to seven seats if you opted for a pack that included two baby seats and it also had two trunks. As if that were not enough, it gained the highest score in the safety test. All this made it a car that swept the competitors in terms of performance and habitability. But the thing does not end there. Tesla sells its models on the internet and in Apple-like stores, making the shopping experience very special. Most of the problems that the vehicle may have, such as irregular speeds of the windshield wiper or that the retractable door handles do not fully deploy, are solved while the client sleeps and the car is connected through Wi-Fi to the internet getting updates of software.
Something surprising was that after the Roadster was released and before betting on the Model S, Tesla was prototyping a hybrid car with a combustion engine that served to recharge the batteries. They eventually dismissed it because they realized it went against everything they believed in.
Tesla commissioned the design of the Model S from Fisker, a famous designer who had designed concept ones for brands such as BMW or Mercedes, but the first sketches were not to Tesla's liking so they paid him what they owed him and Fisker was fired. Fisker, by his own part, then set up Fisker Automotive and released a hybrid sedan with a design pretty similar to the first sketches he had prepared for the Model S, and apparently had used the money that Tesla paid him to finance the launch of the business. In addition, Fisker convinced several VC funds that were through negotiations with Tesla to turn over and finally invest in his own company instead of in Tesla. Elon Musk decide to sue Fisker for theft of intellectual property and plagiarism but the judge did not agree with them.
The first prototype of the Model S was based on a Mercedes CLS to with the batteries embedded in the bottom of the chassis and all control electronics put inside the trunk. With this maneuver they tried to attract investors, and finally Daimler became a shareholder of Tesla and asked then for technical support for its own future electric vehicles.
At the same time that the development of what would become the Model S, the designer Franz Von Holzhausen joined Tesla, who had worked for brands such as Ford, VW, GM and Mazda. Specifically, Holzhausen had worked on the secret project that had relaunched the VW brand in North America: the New Bettle, the one with a vase on the dashboard. The New Beetle was a success and put VW back on top in America. Musk captivated him by exposing that he would have creative freedom and the possibility of revolutionizing the automotive world. Holzhausen accepted and left a secure, well-paid position at Mazda to go to a start-up, and at the time he had no idea of the financial hardships Tesla was going through. When he signed the contract and had to go to IKEA himself to buy his office table and chair as well as drawing supplies, he began to be aware of where was then.
The Model S would become one of the first cars in the world to use an aluminum chassis, which was essential to achieve the target performance and range. In addition, the capacitive touch control screen between the two front seats was the first in the world of 17 inches, it must be said that the iPad was not already invented.
In 2009, the official presentation of the Model S was made with the prototype built on the CLS, although no one knew that. But one thing is to make a prototype and another completely different to manufacture it for the market. The stroke of luck came in 2010 when a production plant that belonged to Toyota and GM was put up for sale and Tesla bought it for a ridiculous amount of 42 million (the plant was worth 1 billion before the crisis of 2008), and also Toyota bought 2.5% of Tesla shares for 50 million. You could say that Tesla earned $ 8 million and a free production plant in the operation.


### Solarcity
Musk's cousins were also entrepreneurs. When they were young, they started a software company called Everdream that made applications for the management and day-to-day life of companies. One day while driving to the Burning Man festival, the cousins told Musk that now that they had earn enough money what they wanted was to do something for the world, and so Musk told them that a good sector for that purpose was photovoltaic electricity generation ... so they set Solarcity and later Musk became the main shareholder. Basically Solarcity offered a rental service for domestic solar panels. Tesla, SpaceX, and Solarcity form a perfect symbiotic cycle. Tesla provides the battery technology for Solarcity's battery walls, whereas the last one serves as energy supplier to Tesla's superchargers on the roads, and at the same time SpaceX provides research into new materials for both.
