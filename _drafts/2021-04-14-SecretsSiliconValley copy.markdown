It is widely known that setting a start-up is one of the hardest thing you could do in your career. It takes a lot of time and effort without being sure it’s gonna work while you are risking a big amount of money. Many entrepreneurs have really good technical skills about the product or service they are trying to put into market, but also many of them have no expertise when it comes to manage the business itself and dealing with investors. That’s the gap Scot Kupor tries to fill with his book “Secrets of Sand Hill Road”. The author got a great background working at tech companies like HP before he moved to managing a venture capital firm and he puts all that valuable knowledge in this book to help those entrepreneurs who want to play their cards properly when getting investors for their companies.

## What is VC? Does it fit your company?

Money is for a company what fuel is for an engine. So when it comes to set up from scratch your business the first step to follow in order to gather money is finding a business angel. Usually the first business angels for an entrepreneur are, apart from himself, his family and friends. But sometimes it is possible to find an external investor, willing to take huge risks, who wants to play his part also. At the very beginning of a company there is no profit, everything are losses because there are no clients yet. All the money gathered during this early stage is call *seed capital*. But when the company crosses the *break even* (income equals outcome so there's no profit or loss) it is more likely that other investors are willing to put their money in the business because now what the company needs is to expand his operations instead of just surviving. Here is when Venture Capital funds turns to be vital. Basically a Venture Capital fund is like a collection of investors (called Limited Partners) who put their money together into a company (or a bunch of companies) in exchange for a share of the ownership. The fund is managed by the General Partners, so the LP sometimes even do not know in which company their money is invested. At the end of the cycle the LP aim to recover their investments by an IPO (Initial Purchase Offer).

Maybe you are wondering why the company, in order to get the money, does not ask for it to a regular bank as a loan, instead of make an arrangement with a VC fund. Well the first part of the answer is because banks tend to run away from businesses with no incomes and low cash flows. And the second part of the answer is because the money that the VC fund puts into the company becomes a structural asset, whereas a loan from a bank has to be totally returned plus the interest. That's why for many start-ups there is no choice and they need to yield part of the ownership and management. But if your start-up, for some reason, is able to create incomes and profit since the beginning then maybe you should consider the typical loan option.

## How to convince investors

Contrary to what people may think, the VC fund do not pay too much attention to the company itself when it comes to decide whether inventing on it or not. There are three points the investors focus on when making up their mind:

- **People**: human beings that are behind the business are vital for the investors. Usually there are two types of start-up: product-first company and company-first company. Product-first companies are those that were founded because the entrepreneur found a solution (by means of a product or service) to a customer need and then he set the company , whereas company-first companies are those that were founded because the owner wanted to rise a company and then he finds a business or market to compete in. Investors love the first ones. They want to know wether the entrepreneur has the proper knowledge about the product and the market and, what's more important, the mindset that lead him to come up with the idea. They also want to check wether he or she is strong headed enough to stick to his target.
- **Product**: the investors know that it is very likely that the initial product or service will not arrive to the market as it was first designed. So they want to know which data the company took for their analysis, which assumptions were taken, whether the management mindset is flexible enough to pivot the idea when it is necessary.
- **Market**: this is the most important thing for the investors, how many people there are out for the product or service. If the idea and product or service are good but there are not many potential customers then no one will be willing to put his money there.

## How to deal with investors

When a VC fund decides to invest in the company, all the conditions related to financial and management relation between the two parts are written down into the *term sheet*. The VC fund provides money to the company along different stages if the company fulfil the goals during the previous stage. Why the company does not ask for all the money it needs in the first stage? Well, firstly because a VC fund usually do not exceed 100 million $ capitalisation, but even if the VC fund could provide such amount of money that would not be a great deal for the entrepreneur because he or she would be forced to sell also a huge share of the company. On the other hand, if an start-up is successfully going through different financing rounds it is more likely that the investors will be willing to put more money on the table in exchange for a less company share because now they see less risks around the company. That's why sometimes it is very suitable that the company is underestimated rather than receive more money that you should and then not be able to fulfil the expectations, with the risk of not getting enough money to perform company goals.

As I said, the investors are much more focus on the people and the market than on the company or product itself. They expect from the entrepreneurs to have a great vision and mindset. They want know how their brain works, if they are able to go through the pain that managing a start-up takes, if they are strong but at the same time flexible enough to pivot his ideas when the customer is asking for that, and obviously want to know whether they have the proper knowledge about the product and the market.

Unfortunately, the number of financing rounds that an entrepreneur is going to face through all his lives is very limited compared with how many the investors do. So here it is a great advantage for the investor because they have a huge experience in this. This gap of knowledge is what Scott Kuppor, a general manager of a Silicon Valley VC fund,  wants to fill with his book *Secrets of Sand Hill Road*. So if you are an entrepreneur or you just want to know more about how this world works I strongly recommend you reading that. There you will find with details what you should take into account at every moment and the potential threats you could be facing.
