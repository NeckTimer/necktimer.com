<h1 style="color: #1E1D1F"><b>Summary</b></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: #1E1D1F">Driven by a relentless passion for technology I have been always pursuing working on cutting-edge projects which challenge my skills. I started my career in a fellowship researching in diesel combustion engines, modeling combustion and initiating in engine calibration. Then I had the chance to try in Energy sector, first in technical areas and then in financial markets as an energy trader developing purchasing strategies, price and customer consumptions predictions and risk hedging. After that experiences I decided to turn back to automotive sector and I had the chance to work at companies like Nissan and Seat as a powertrain development engineer being in charge of engine and traction control modules software calibration. During my free time I like to create useful solutions for several needs by means of coding and CAE design.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: left; color: white">Automotive Sector</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: white">I started my career in automotive sector as a <i>Combustion Reseracher Intern</i> at <b>CMT-Motores Térmicos</b>, a worldwide reference in combustion engines development. That allowed me to learn in a hands-on way about combustion process, models and applications to internal combustion engines. Those knowledge were very useful when I moved to companies like <b>Nissan</b> or <b>SEAT</b> where I worked as a <i>Powertrain Development Engineer</i>, building the powertrain control software for Diesel, Petrol and CNG engines targeting on emissions control, performance and driveability.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: right">Energy Sector</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify">Apart from automotive sector I have always been very curious about energy industries and renewable sources. As an engineer I always pursue efficiency in almost everything and doing that within energy process is a very fulfilling way to do it. I started at energy sector as an <i>Energy Advisor</i> for third sector companies like hotels and hospitals performing energy audits, detecting weak points and predesigning energy saving measures. Then I had the chance to try on energy markets as an <i>Energy Trader.</i> </p>

<h1 style="text-align: left; color: white">Coding</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: white">Coding has been a great part of my daily routine among different jobs, mainly developing macros in <b>VBA</b> to automate processes. On a side I also like to built solutions by means of softaware applications by using programming languages like <b>Swift</b>,<b>Python</b> or <b>Java</b> among others (this website is developed by myself for instance). You can check out my <a href="https://github.com/JCentercreation"><b>GitHub profile</b></a> and take a look to my repositories so you could have an idea about which languages I am used to dealing with. I recently started a <a href="https://www.javiercarrilloblog.com/codingseries"><b>coding series</b></a> tutorials.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: right">CAE Design</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify">During my internship at CMT-Motores I had the chance to learn not only about powertrain devlopment and combustion engines calibration but also about CAE software. I was granted with a scolarship to attend <b>CATIA</b> courses and applying all that knowledge to high efficiency vehicles design performing mechanical parts design and stress analysis for the Shell Eco-Marathon European Championship UPV Team. We won that championship twice in Diesel Category with a fuel efficiency record of 1265 kilometers per liter. This was one of the less glamorous achievements for me but one I most proud of.</p>

<h2 style="color: white"><b>Education</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: white">Since I was a child it was clear for me that I wanted to became an engineer, but which major? Well I liked space shuttles, racing cars, electronic devices and to take into pieces any gadget or toy that was within my reach, so when I grew up I decided to get a <b>BSc. and MSc. in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</b> and I guess it was a right choice because it allowed me to gain a broad knowledge about many engineering realms. Then I got a <b>MSc. in Energy Technology</b> majoring in renewable energies and energy efficiency. </p>
