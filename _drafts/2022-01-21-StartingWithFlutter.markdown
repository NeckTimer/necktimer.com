Hi guys! And happy New Year! ItÂ´s been a while since my last post but here I am again. New year, new rules so my first post of 2022 its related with Google platforms software development. If you are kinda shocked after reading laste sentence I want to let you knnow that my mental health its ok (or at least not worse than last year XD). I know that I always write about iOS development but I think its tyme to be a little bit more open-minded and to learn about other platforms.

I've been recently reading about project Fuchsia and its future prospects as a cross platform operating system so I've rethink the idea of starting with Flutter. Currently Flutter is mainly used as a nonnative developing framework for Android and iOS platforms (you can use it also for web apps development) but it seems that in the future it will became the main framework for Android/Fucshia plattforms. In this post I will describe my first steps with Flutter, from the environment setup to my first chunks of code.





Thanks for reading :)
