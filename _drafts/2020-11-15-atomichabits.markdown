<p style="text-align: justify">James Clear is an entrepreneur, writer, speaker and former athlete who became a best seller author when he published "Atomic Habits" in 2018. Since then, 3 million readers around the world have learnt to empower their lifes by building conscious habits. You can also subscribe to his newsletter and recieve a weekly email with ideas about general productivity, or visit his <a href="https://jamesclear.com">website</a> and check out his blog.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Imagine that you improve your productivity, for instance at work, just a 0,1% daily. Not even a 1% each day, just a 0,1%. And that tiny improvement comes from embracing a new habit, for instance, scheduling your day at work and stick to that schedule instead of randomly execute tasks. Maybe you are now thinking something like: "maybe that is too much effort for just a tiny reward of a 0,1% improvement". And you are completely right, it is absolutely a very low daily improvement for that effort. But we are focusing in the short term, in a day. What would happen at the end of a year sticked to that new habit? Well, I have already work it out for you: a yearly improvement of a 43%! That means that sticking to that habit during 360 days will brings you a productivity improvement of 43%. And that also means that you are able to accomplish a 43% more workload, or on the other hand, you are able to accomplish your current workload but using almost a half of the time it takes now. After a year, that tiny daily improvement does not seem so tiny. That's the power of the atomic habits.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">But how to create that habits? Everyone knows that bulding up a good habit is hard and that, on the other hand, keeping with a bad one is easy. Well, the first thing we do when trying to set up a new good habit is focusing in the goal. "I will start practicing sport to be fit at summer" or "I will not spend money in carbonated drinks in order to save money and travel on holidays with my wife". Those are really good and fair goals. But, as you will discover in this book, we are not approaching properly to the habit. We need to think about the process instead of focusing in the goal. It would be better to say "I will go for a 30 minutes run daily to be fit at summer" or "I will just drink one coke at work and other one at home, at most, to save money ang travel in vaccation". Defining the process accurately is what will make us accomplish the habit."Everyday at 5 pm, when arriving from work I will go for a 30 minutes run around my neighbourhood before preparing dinner" and "When I am at work and tempted to buy another coke, instead of heading to the vending machine, I will check hotel prices I want to visit". Those are accurate habits.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">But that is not enough. What will happen in October when beach season has finished and you are comming back from your holidays in that amazing hotel in Thailand? The "what" should not be at spotlight, and the "how" does not work alone. "I will daily go running at 5 pm when arriving from work and before preparing dinner because I want to be a person who values and takes care of my body" or "When I'm tempted to drink a coke I will think in eating an apple beacause I want to be a healthy person". Definying and embracing the "why" is what will make us stick to the good habit and to get rid of the bad ones.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Throughtout this book James Clear gives you a great guide to build smart habits and to skip from the ones that are draining your time and energy in an unproductive way. All this by making it obvious, attractive, easy and satisfying. Defenetely it is a good guide to follow in order to became the person you want to be.</p>
