<h1><b>Sport Life🏃‍♂️</b></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sport is not only a way to keep you healthier but also happier. I practice sport for two main reasons: the first and most important one is because I enjoy it, and the second one is because it triggers my hormones game to keep me in the right emotions. Since my early days I've always been in touch with sport in a semiprofessional way, at the beggining it was just a way to socialize and develope my body, but when I started college I realized how sport matters in my life in terms of happines and achiving my goals.</p>

<h1 style="color: white"><b>Reading📚</b></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: white">When I am not coding, filming and editing videos or doing my workout, I like to spend my time (above all those spare hours when commuting) by reading. Personally I am not a big fan of literature (please don't judge me) because I rather prefer reading about tech, science, economy and lately I am very hooked on memoirs about people who did great things for this world (the most of them within tech and science realm ;)</p>
