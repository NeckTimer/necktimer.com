<p style="text-align: justify">This book was written by Donald Miller, an american writer and marketing expert who helps companies, business owners and people in general to build a proper marketing strategy which allows them to be much more successfull with their businesses and life.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Since Marketing was labeled as a proper business development realm in the early years of the twenty century many gurus and showmen have tried to find the philosopher's stone that empowers to any company to sell any product or service, never mind if it solves any customer issue or not, to any client, never mind if that client is the target of that product, at any price, never mind if it is a good value for money or not. Maybe you are thinking that they finally did, spilled the secret to Steve Jobs and Apple was founded then...but they didn't. In this book you can discover what should be the real goal of marketing applied to your company, which are the core motivations that drive human beings to get a product or service and to pay for it, and you will learn also a methodology to apply that principles to your real business.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Many companies use marketing to accomplish one unique goal: sell more. And I'm not gonna be naive or cynic and say that should not be the purpose of any company, because companies are built to offer a value to the society and get money (at the end money is a value exchanging vehicle) for that. But if companies approach to marketing in just that way, to make a quick buck, they are making a great mistake. As I previously said, companies are out there to offer a value to the customers, but what is a value? Well since the first days of humankind until this days, human beings we have been pursuing the same primary goals: food (getting alive), home (security) and a partner to rise childs (survival of the specie). Any product or service who is been sold solves at least one of this three needs. And if you are wondering about, for instance, what is about the last iPhone? Why people is buying a 1000$ product that solves a communication need that could be also be satisfied with, at least, a half price device? Does it provide food, a home or a partner? And the answer is absolutely yes. For many people having the last iPhone is a way of getting social respect. That social respect can offer security because it is more likely that more people want to be your friend, because we associate having money to being successful and everyones want to be a friend of a successful person, and so if someday you are in trouble with something or someone then the more friends you have the more likely you will overcome that issue, and also social respect is also valuable in order to find a partner... I guess you get the point. So at the end of the day, the main target of marketing for any company should not be selling a product but enhancing customers lifes according to that three major needs as backgorund, and the money will follow. Oftentimes, in order to achieve that goal it is suitable to recommend buying a product or not to do that, because what a company should desire is not only selling a product today, but also sell a product tomorrow...and to accomplish that, the customers need to trust the company in the long term and not only today.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Ok, now we know what the customers need, but how could the company show up as the one which is going to solve that needs? Well this is the key question that Donald Miller answers in this book, and it is also one of the first mistakes that many companies make when approaching to their clients. Companies usually try to stand as the heroe. People we do not want an hero inside our lifes, we want to be the hero of our lifes!!! So the companies that show up as the hero, the ones who introduce themself as the rescuer are the ones that are rejected. Otherwise the companies who try to be the guide instead of the hero are the most successful ones in the long term. Don't get me wrong, as Donald Miller said: the company should show clearly what sort of problems can solve for the customers, and even not only that, but also have to show the drawbacks of not getting the product or hiring the services and the benefits of doing it. But as I said, by taking the client into the spotlight. "Together we can achieve a happier life" is better and completely different to "without me you will not get a happier life". Think about movies: the main character always needs a guide, always. The main character, the hero, is not an hero at all at the beginning, usually he is a mess but he enhances his life hitting a goal and finally becomes an hero overcoming a bunch of issues and difficulties thanks to the guide's advices. And those are the sort of movies and characters usually viewers hook on, in the same way we want our clients to be hooked on our company or brand. So it seems reasonable for a company to be the guide, to show what and where the client is now and what and where he could be by overcoming a difficulty following the guide's advices.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">At this point I guess everyone now knows that building a good marketing campaign for your company is pretty similar to creating a great movie story. Donald Miller proposes a methodology to build that great story for your client and how your company can fit inside that story.</p>
