Hi guys, it's been a while since my last post. You might be thinking that something bad had happen to me, or that maybe I had lost the passion for coding. Luckily none of this things occured, indeed today I have a great announcement for all of you. As a second thought it is not an announcement, is a little spoiler about what is going on during the next months in my side hustle adventure. If you visit this webpage frecuently you migh noticed about that <?> link in the navigation bar (on the top right corner).

Ok, I stop beating around the bushes. The thing is that my first software product for MacOS devices will be released in few days. What is it about? Well I told you this is a short spoiler, not an unveil event :). But prior to the presentation I must clarify some very important points about the business model. Defenetly I'm a product guy, which means that I'm not used to pay attention to the other core areas of the business. For instance I'm thinking about putting the product into market as a subscription service. Honestly I do not believe in single-payment option taking into account that I want to mantain and improve the service for years so in order to make it profitable I should choose the subscription model instead of a single-payment business model.

You might be wondering what is the software product about and which sort of features it brings. What I can say is that I am developing the software for content creators purposes, but I take into account that nowadays a great portion of the population is very active on social media...defenetely many people will take an advantage of these product features. I stumbled with the idea of making a product like this when I was searching it for my own youtube channel and I realised that there was nothing similar in the market that satisfied my needs so I decided to built it by my own.

Another thing that I want to share with all you guys is that it is very likely that you will be able to follow the behind scenes development process and details about the product. I am thinking about making specific Youtube videos about how I develope and take some decisions for the business. I strongly believe that this sort of videos could help and inspire many people that currently have great ideas running in their heads but are doubting about taking action (which is what happens to me many times). At the same time I thing it is also a great idea in order to get feedback from other developers and customers, making me improve the product and sticking to the right line.

Well, that's all guys. More info in following post, stay tunned for upcoming updates.

Thanks for reading :)
